# clj-sandbox

This is my attempt to create a library that allows easy sandboxing of clojure code, something like a secure eval functionality for untrusted code.

## Usage


1) create a .java.policy file to grant your code rights.

2) in your code:
  (use 'net.licenser.sandbox)
  (enable-security-manager)
  (def my-sandbox (create-sandbox 'user secure-tester))
  (my-sandbox "(+ 1 1)")
